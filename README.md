# REALTY - [Visit Realty](https://realty-app.netlify.app)
Realty is a proof of concept solution for crypto-based real estate purchase/payments with stablecoins. It builds on the idea of having another option for asset listing, investment, saving and payments in the real-estate ecosystem aside fiat currency.

## Project track 
 - Creator Track 
    - Stablecoins can be used for asset payments and listing, current support is only our test coin — [TUSDT](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0x4A80319043e4f56562212C10Ad86cDe28083cB10) which you can request for from any team member. Further development of the project for mainstream usage will involve mainnet stablecoins like USDT, DAI etc.

    - NFTs are used for verifying listed assets authenticity on Realty and also as proof of ownership of an asset within Realty.

## Contract Flow
- listProperty : to submit an asset for listing 
- approval : this should be done right before listProperty to give allowance to the Realty contract to transfer 0.5 of the stablecoin to Realty as a listing fee.
- minfNFT : to mint an NFT for the submitted property and thereby publiclly listing the asset for viewing and purchase by everyone.
- payForProperty : to pay for a particular property and have it's NFT transferred to you.
- addPropertyToSavingVault : Unable to pay upfront, add listed property to savings vault for instalmental savings.
- Deposit: sends a given amount of token to the contract. Tokens gets accumulated in order to amount to product price.
- Withdrawal: occurs once total savings equals product price. User withdrawals property price into wallet address for property purchase.
